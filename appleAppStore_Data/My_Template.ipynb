    "3. **Missing values:**\n",
    "     - 643988 missing values in Developer_Website. \n",
    "     - 1109 missing values in Developer_Url.\n",
    "     - 490 missing values in Price\n",
    "     - 224 missing values in Size_Bytes\n",
    "     - 3 missing values in Released\n",
    "     - 1 missing value in App_Name\n",
    "### **Other observations:**\n",
    "1. The dataset has **6865 duplicated rows based on App_Name column**. It justifies the unique values count being differnt for **App_Id** and **App_Name**.\n",
    "     - Although **App_Name** may have duplications, the records are unique as a whole, with varying versions, AppIds, and release dates.\n",
    "2. Even if some of the Apps might be duplicated but the **AppStore_Url**'s unique value count is same as number of rows in the dataset. It is so because **App_Id** is unique for every single **AppStore_Url**.\n",
    "3. There are **26 Genre** in the given dataset and it has no missing values.\n",
    "4. There are **5 unique values in the Content_Rating** column: '4+' '17+' '9+' '12+' & 'Not yet rated'.\n",
    "5. There are **255914 unique values in Size_Bytes**. \n",
    "     - But **interesting thing is that range of Size_Bytes is from 26.98MB to 71.51GB.**\n",
    "6. **Released** and **Updated** columns should be converted to DateTime dtype.\n",
    "     - **Z in these columns' values represent the Zulu time** (UTC: Coordinated Universal Time Zone), meaning the times listed are in a standardized global time format without adjustments for local time zones.\n",
    "7. The price for every single app is written in **USD currency**. The **Price column** has 88 unique values ranging from 0$ to 999.99$.\n",
    "8. We have **509285 DeveloperIds**, **505255 Developers** names, **514106 Developer_Urls** and only **403809 Developer_Website**.\n",
    "     - A **high count *(643988)* of missing** values in Developer_Website shows that mostly Developers on Applestore don't give their websites.\n",
    "     - If we take a closer look at the **Developer_Urls**, this columns values are being formed by initial link, developer name and developer id and at the end ?uo=4. We can use this information to impute missing values here.\n",
    "     - The difference between unique value count of **DeveloperIds** and **Developer** column suggests that:\n",
    "       - Either some developers have the same name.\n",
    "       - Or same developers are using different Ids.\n",
    "9.  We have **88 unique Prices** for different apps in the dataset.\n",
    "10. **Average_User_Rating** and **Current_Version_Score** seem same because both of them have **45073 unique values** and these unique values are also same for both columns.\n",
    "11. **Reviews** and **Current_Version_Reviews** also seem same because they both have **13668 unique values** and these unique values are also same for both columns."

    "A8: We tried to find a correlation between app size and price but found that, except for a few exceptions, the size of the app is irrelevant to the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Who are the top 10 app-producing developers?\\\n",
    "A9: The top 10 app-producing developers are ChowNow, Touch2Success, Alexander Velimirovic, MINDBODY, Incorporated, Phorest, OFFLINE MAP TRIP GUIDE LTD, Magzter Inc., ASK Video, RAPID ACCELERATION INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED, and Nonlinear Educating Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What types of genres attract which types of clients in terms of revenue?\\\n",
    "A10: Some interesting points need further analysis and attention, such as what kind of Business & Utilities apps are bought by or for children. It was found that the information stored in the content rating attribute is not very reliable and that there is a possibility that an app is rated for 9+ but is actually an e-book with unsuitable topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. How do app releases per content rating compare year on year?\\\n",
    "A11: Clearly, the children's category is taking the lead, but as pointed out earlier, the content rating of non-kids apps is also rated under the children's category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. How does user rating compare to price?\\\n",
    "A12: The higher the user rating, the higher the price of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. How does user rating compare to MB size?\\\n",
    "A13: The higher the user rating, the larger the size in MB of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How do YoY breakdowns per genre based on app price compare?\\\n",
    "A14: Educational apps contribute more revenue in terms of app sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. Interdependency of numeric attributes on each other\\\n",
    "Answer 16: Few attributes show strong dependence on each other, except for Average_User_Rating and Current_Version_Score."

    "#### The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Apple App Store dataset and identify insights based on the data. By doing so, we aim to project customer dynamics and demands to developers and relevant stakeholders, helping them generate more business for their upcoming applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> During this EDA exercise, we have achieved several milestones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have cleaned the dataset from null values.\n",
    "- No duplications have been found. Although the app names have duplications, they are unique records with different versions, AppIds, and release dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our findings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaming apps are the most downloaded apps from the store.\n",
    "- The top 10 highest rated primary genres based on average user ratings are Weather, Games, Photo & Videos, Music, and Books.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is important to note that the information stored in the content rating attribute may not always be reliable. There is a possibility that an app rated for 9+ may contain unsuitable topics, such as e-books."
